Got the twitter api working with our framework.
Pulls twitter off his ufo search link, and posts
a users profile picture and a link to their twitter
page and the tweet all under a control group.

Got the camera working, it opens the camera in the phone to take the photo
and stores it locally in a cache folder with the app.  Didn't add
in any uploading to server functions.

Ran short on time for maps.  I have a map loading, but it's just an insert
from the google maps code to the maps section of the framework.
I could pull lat & long data from the gps to update a current location but
what I have isn't really accessing the google maps api.

All of this is working on my android device.
